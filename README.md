This Java project is a basic implementation of face detection using OpenCV library. Here's a brief overview of the main components and functionalities:

1. **OpenCV Library**: This project depends on OpenCV, an open-source computer vision and machine learning software library. It's used for various image processing tasks, including face detection.

2. **Main Class (`JFaceDetection`)**: This is the entry point of the application. It loads the native OpenCV library, reads an image file, performs face detection on the image, draws rectangles around detected faces, saves the processed image, and prints a message indicating the completion of the detection process.

3. **Face Detection**: The face detection is done using a pre-trained cascade classifier. In this case, the classifier used is "lbpcascade_frontalface.xml", which is a pre-trained model provided by OpenCV for detecting frontal faces. The `CascadeClassifier` class from OpenCV is used to load this classifier.

4. **Image Processing**: Detected faces are represented as rectangles drawn onto the original image using the `Imgproc.rectangle()` method. The processed image is then saved to an output file.

5. **Input and Output**: The input image file ("messivsronaldo.png") is assumed to be located in the "images" directory relative to the project root. The processed image is saved as "messivsronaldo_out.png" in the same directory.

Overall, this project demonstrates a simple implementation of face detection using OpenCV in Java. It can serve as a starting point for more advanced projects involving computer vision and image processing tasks.
